 is a modern, full‑stack portfolio web application showcasing projects, skills, experience, and education in a clean, responsive design. It is built with Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind CSS, with smooth, interactive animations powered by Framer Motion.

Content is managed through an admin dashboard and persisted in MongoDB using Mongoose. Projects feature thumbnails, tags, and detailed pages with image carousels and live/demo links. The About page includes a concise bio, headshot, resume link, and an AI‑assisted Skills Explorer to enhance the skills list.

The application emphasizes performance, accessibility, and developer experience, using server actions for data access, caching for fast reads, and a component‑driven UI for consistency across pages.
